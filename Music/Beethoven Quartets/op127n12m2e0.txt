m13 I b3 I6
Note: Beethoven Crashing Thirds (Discuss which inversion to label.)
m14 V4/3 b4 V6/5/V b4.67 V2
Note: IV9 may be a little strange, but Iâ€™m hearing a very rich predominant harmony on b1.67. Those added notes could be explained away as NHTs, but I hear them as chord members in themselves.
m15 I6 b1.67 IV9 b2 V7 b3 I || b3.67 V
m16 V7
m17 I6/4 b4 V4/3/IV
Note: is that b1.67 V4/3/IV too much to notate? Put it down primarily because of the Gb, which of course could be a chromatic NT, but to me is clearly really acting as a chordal seventh. Maybe inconsistent, however, since similar instances of I-V7-I made from passing tones I chose earlier not to notate.
